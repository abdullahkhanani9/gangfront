# About

As a group of six (a blend of two team triangles), it's extremely difficult to manage work and facilitate a functioning environment in which a valuable end product can actually be produced with the use of good communication, collaboration, and effort. However, we plan to utilize assets such as pull requests, online calling, and in class discussions and planning in order to accomplish our goals as a team.
